# Probabilistic Roadmaps for Flying Relay Path Planning

This repository contains an implementation of the PRFI algorithm as well as the code to reproduce the numerical experiments of the paper "Probabilistic Roadmaps for Flying Relay Path Planning" by Pham Q. Viet and Daniel Romero. 

The paper was presented at the 2023 IEEE Global Communications Conference - GLOBECOM 2023; URL: [conference paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10437427)

The journal version is available at [journal article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11752v2).

- The implementation of the proposed PRFI is inside the folder named "code".

- For static UE: [illu-video-1.mp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bAWKnuUdAQ) compares the proposed PRFI algorithm and its benchmarks.
- For moving UE: [illu-video-2.mp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvs_qh_3gbE) illustate PRFI for Moving UE in operation.
