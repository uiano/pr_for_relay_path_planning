# Probabilistic Roadmaps for Flying Relay Path Planning

This repository contains an implementation of the PRFI algorithm as well as the code to reproduce the numerical experiments of the paper "Probabilistic Roadmaps for Flying Relay Path Planning" by Pham Q. Viet and Daniel Romero. 

[The code along with some videos will be pushed shortly. ]
