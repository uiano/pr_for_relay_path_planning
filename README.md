# Probabilistic Roadmaps for Flying Relay Path Planning

This repository contains an implementation of the PRFI algorithm as well as the code to reproduce the numerical experiments of the paper "Probabilistic Roadmaps for Flying Relay Path Planning" by Pham Q. Viet and Daniel Romero. 

The conference was published at the 2023 IEEE Global Communications Conference - GLOBECOM 2023; URL: [conference paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10437427)

- For static UE: [illu-video-1.mp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwEpbFMzJXY) and [illu-video-2.mp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nldyPijbKpE) illustrate the PRFI algorithm and
  its benchmarks.
- For moving UE: [illu-video-3.mp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYBJi71kYr8) illustate PRFI for Moving UE in operation.
- Implementation of the proposed algorithm is inside the folder named "code".
