# Probabilistic Roadmaps for Flying Relay Path Planning

This repository contains an implementation of the PRFI algorithm as well as the code to reproduce the numerical experiments of the paper "Probabilistic Roadmaps for Flying Relay Path Planning" by Pham Q. Viet and Daniel Romero. 

- "illustration-video.mp4" illustrates the PRFI algorithm and its benchmarks.
- An implementation of the proposed algorithm is stored inside folder "code".
