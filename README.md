# Probabilistic Roadmaps for Flying Relay Path Planning

This repository contains an implementation of the PRFI algorithm as well as the
code to reproduce the numerical experiments of the paper "Probabilistic Roadmaps
for Flying Relay Path Planning" by Pham Q. Viet and Daniel Romero. The paper was
published at 2023 IEEE Global Communications Conference - GLOBECOM 2023; URL:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10437427

- [illu-video-1.mp4](https://github.com/uiano/pr_for_relay_path_planning/blob/main/illu-video-1.mp4) and "illu-video-2.mp4" illustrate the PRFI algorithm and
  its benchmarks.
- An implementation of the proposed algorithm is inside the folder named "code".
